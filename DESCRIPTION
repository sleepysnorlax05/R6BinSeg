Title: R6-Based Binary Segmentation with Rcpp Backends
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Implements binary segmentation for change-point detection using an 
    R6 interface with interchangeable cost-function objects derived from a common 
    CostBase abstraction. Supports both user-defined cost functions in R and 
    high-performance C++ cost implementations via Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. The 
    framework is designed for extensibility, allowing new cost functions and 
    segmentation strategies to be added seamlessly while maintaining efficient 
    C++ backends for core computation.
